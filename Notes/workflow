// step wise instructions for creating an endpoint in this

// 1. create server.js ,in that mention the necessary variables for creatign a server, running the port and connecting to mongo
// 2. the flow of the code is very important and the ordering of the code is important

// 3. order of these 3 values


flow

first url route hits the controller,
the controller contacts the service - userService.js
service contacts with the model, 
here the model finally communicates with the database and fetch or post or update records accordingly



//always use cors first , these are middlewares
server.use(cors());

//calling the below function to execute the server actions
server.use(express.json());
//using the routes
server.use(routes);

// next step is to create routes.js, give the controller names and the method correctly

// nect is to create a user service 

// next is to create a user model with the schema, use the property names mentioned here exactly in the postman

// in one usercontroller itself i have added the two methods one for post(createUserController) and the other is for fetching and getting the datas get(getDataControllerfn)

// postman

// in postman we have to pass the url with the port number we mentioned and choose the post or get 

// http://localhost:8000/user/getAll ------ paste this in the url section
// select none option
// click send
// then you will receive the records which got inserted in the database

//like wise for the post method you give this url 

//http://localhost:8000/user/create ---- this is the post endpoint, 
// choose body 
// select raw and also selct the text type as "json"
// and if you want you can choose the headers and give the key as "content-type and values as application/json"
// pass the properties and values
// click send btn
// you will see the "user created successfully"
// and if you check in the mongo db ,you will be able to see the records got inserted

//each time run the server in the vs code using "node server.js"
